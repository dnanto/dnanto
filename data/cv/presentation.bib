  abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology have increased the computational demands required for processing, identifying, and analyzing large and complex datasets. Because Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) offer insight into the molecular mechanisms of pathogen evolution, virulence, host preference, lineage calculations, and the emergence of highly pathogenic strains; detecting them rapidly within large sequence readsets would be highly valuable, as well as efficiently performing metagenomic studies of biological communities without prior knowledge of their composition.  To address these critical needs, Noblis developed a preliminary suite of novel algorithms that utilizes the strengths of the CRAY XMT 2 supercomputer to perform reference-based multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and SNP detection.  This implementation uses next generation sequence reads as input and aligns them against a customized reference library, which can be specific \textendash{} consisting of one strain or a group of strains belonging to the same species, or highly varied \textendash{} containing bacterial, viral, and mammalian DNA.  The vast resources provided by the CRAY XMT 2 allow MSA and SNP detection at Noblis to proceed at a significantly faster rate than current industry standards without sacrificing precision.  As an example, the process of aligning reads and deriving SNPs from 53 million 100 bp reads against a 3,227 Mbp human genome reference sequence was completed in approximately one hour.  Additionally, Noblis performed a theoretical metagenomic analysis of 2.7 million sequence reads aligned against a reference library of 16 bacterial genomes with an average size of 5.5 Mbp.  This analysis accurately determined the makeup of all microbial species present at a total runtime of 37 seconds.  Our results demonstrate rapid sequence alignment of large datasets against a high number of reference genomes, thus creating a method for fast detection of SNPs and accurate identification of all organisms in the metagenomic samples.}
